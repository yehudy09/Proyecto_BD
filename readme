This project is based on the following problem:

Elite Bike Rental is a new bike shop located in a suburb in NY, offering a wide 
range of bicycles and related accessories. John, the shopâ€™s owner, has been 
conducting his daily business mostly on paper. 
The company records sales on preprinted forms, which contains the invoice 
number and date of the sale, the customer and the employee involved in the sale 
and the product being sold. Employee and customer information is maintained on 
sheets of paper.
For each employee, this includes his/her social insurance number, first and last 
name, and home phone number. For each customer, the company records the 
first, middle (if any) and last name, as well as at least one phone number and 
home address (consisting of street number and post code). To keep track of the 
product inventory, John uses a spreadsheet program to record the number, 
name, price and quantity of the products in stock. For each product, a range of 
services is offered. 
The spreadsheet program is also used to list the type (e.g., repair, exchange) and 
charge for each service. Multiple types of service may be offered to one product 
(e.g., repair and exchange for bikes) and a service may be offered to multiple 
products (e.g., repair for bikes and accessories) at different prices. 
John spends a lot of time maintaining this information. Recently, he has decided 
to use database to manage all this data
